  <p> You grab te pickaxe without much hesitation. </p>
  <p> "SO" You hear, booming down and across the tavern</p>
  <p> "You chose the pickaxe. Seems like a good choice, eh? Try it out then." </p>
  <p> You slowly dig the pickaxe into the rock below you and start descending. You mst hold on with all your might, and as you look downvyou are starting to doubt that you will make it all the way without falling.</p>
  <p> A few minutes of anguish finally come to a close, and you are finnally touching solid ground again.</p>
  <p> You somehow made it down, bu you are now extremely exhausted, and you feel like you can barely lift your arms. </p>
  <p> as you look up, panting, you see... a mirror. But as you blink, it dissapeares and you just see a dark path leading deeper. </p>
  <p> But then you turn around and see a giant underground pool that you couldn't see from the top. </p>
